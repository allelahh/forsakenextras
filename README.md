# forsakenextras
Repo for assets like audios/videos/images for a QoL script for the Roblox game "Forsaken" which gives no advantages;
and is therefore NOT malicious (i'm serious), and shouldn't need to be removed.
don't worry github mods, or users

## additional notes:
- thanks ivannetta for most if not all of the file/asset downloading logic and some parts of the script about music replacement, the killer emoting gui and giving me documentation about scripting for script executors, your script did give me a stroke tho
